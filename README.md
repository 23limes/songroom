# Songroom

Songroom is a multi-user cloud Karaoke player that allows a group of people to
create a shared Karaoke queue that is played via an HTML5 Karaoke player on a
separate screen.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, you'll need Grunt, Bower, and Yeoman Polymer
installed:

    npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-polymer

Next you'll need to install NPM and Bower dependencies:

    npm install && bower install

Once you've done that, you can get a development server going:

    grunt serve

The app will now be running on `localhost:8080`.
